                        should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new
                        information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further
                        information before deciding whether to reinstate or
                        resettle the market. Except where the Site has announced

                        shortly after the end of the event in question. the Site
                        may settle (or part-settle) some markets before the
                        official result is declared (or may increase a
                        customer's 'available to bet' balance by the minimum
                        potential winnings of that customer on a given market)

                        if: (i) the official result is different to the result
                        on which the Site initially settled the market; or (ii)

                        in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant
                        governing body, providing such a decision is given
                        within 90 days after the scheduled completion date. If
                        no official ruling is announced in this 90 day period,

                        void, except for bets on any markets which have been

                        void.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some markets refer to the
                        length of time until an occurrence in the event (e.g.
                        time of first goal). If an event happens in stoppage or
                        injury time after any regular time period then it will
                        be deemed to have occurred at the end of the regular
                        time period. For example, if a goal is scored in first
                        half stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed
                        to have occurred on 45 minutes.

                        take part in the next round or event for which they have
                        qualified. Markets will be settled after the qualifying
                        stage and any subsequent disqualification or amendment
                        to the result will not count.

                        relevant winning selection, the stake money is first
                        reduced in proportion by multiplying it by the sum of
                        the number of winners expected, divided by the number of
                        actual winners (i.e. stake multiplied by (number of
                        winners expected/number of actual winners)). The
                        winnings are then paid to the successful backers on this
                        'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded
                        price) and the remaining stake money is paid to the
                        appropriate layers.

                        <br />
                        For example, a reference to the start time of a football
                        match, relates to the local kick-off &nbsp; &nbsp;time.

                        market is otherwise loaded using incorrect information
                        or includes any obvious error, then the Site reserves
                        the right to suspend the market and (providing it acts

                        on which they place a bet is their intended selection.
                        <br />
                        For example, in the case of a competitor bearing the
                        same name as another individual not competing in the
                        relevant event, the onus is on the customer to ensure
                        that they know which competitor the Site has loaded into
                        the relevant market and to ensure that they are placing
                        their bet on their chosen competitor.

                        to the commencement of the race it will be removed and

                        a race, the stewards declare a greyhound a non-runner,
                        the Site will resettle the market and will void all bets
                        that were placed on that runner only. The Site will then
                        apply a reduction factor to all bets placed on the
                        winner (or placegetters in the case of place markets)
                        based on that runner's weighted average price.

                        Subsequent disqualifications, appeals or amendments to
                        the result will be disregarded.

                        otherwise declared void, or in the event of a walkover,
                        all bets on that race will be void.

                        The Site Non-Runner Rule
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Site's non-runner rule
                        relates to the adjustment of odds on bets already
                        matched when a horse in a race is declared a non-runner.
                        In order to make the adjustment the Site applies a
                        reduction factor to the remaining runners. The reduction
                        factor allocated to a non-runner is a calculation (the
                        details of which are described below) of that horse's
                        chances of winning (or being placed, etc as appropriate)
                        and is applied to bets already matched on the other
                        runners in the relevant market or markets.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any horse listed when the
                        relevant market is loaded which does not subsequently
                        come under starter's orders is deemed to be a
                        non-runner.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the market is loaded each
                        horse is given a 'reduction factor', based on a forecast
                        price, which is expressed as a percentage. These
                        reduction factors may be updated periodically at the
                        discretion of the Site based on trading in the market,
                        but after approximately 15 minutes (approximately 5
                        minutes for Australian and US markets) from the
                        scheduled 'off' time of a given race, they will be
                        updated only in exceptional circumstances. The current
                        reduction factor percentage for each horse can be viewed
                        on the 'info' page on the Site website or by asking the
                        Helpdesk.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reductions will be made to both
                        win and place markets but applied differently (as
                        described below), and horses will have a different
                        reduction factor for each market.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the Site becomes
                        aware that a horse is an official non-runner or a highly
                        likely non-runner, following a statement to the press
                        from connections, the following will happen:

                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All matched bets on that horse
                        will be void and the horse will be removed from the
                        market.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the win market: if the
                        reduction factor of the non-runner is 2.5% or greater,
                        the traded price of all the matched bets on the
                        remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to
                        the non-runner's final reduction factor and all the
                        unmatched offers to lay will be cancelled. If the
                        non-runner's reduction factor is less than 2.5%,
                        reductions will not be applied and unmatched bets will
                        not be cancelled.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place market the
                        reduction factor of all non-runners will be applied
                        (even if less than 2.5%) and the potential winnings in
                        relation to matched bets on the remaining horses will be
                        reduced by an amount equal to the non-runner's final
                        reduction factor. Only if the non-runner's reduction
                        factor is 4.0% or greater will all the unmatched offers
                        to lay be cancelled.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the reduction factors on
                        the remaining horses will be adjusted to reflect their
                        improved chance of winning.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction factors are not
                        applied to bets which are struck in-play. However, if a
                        market is turned in-play prematurely by error (or, for
                        example, there is a false start), all bets matched
                        during this time will be subject to any later reduction
                        factor, provided the market is turned out of play before
                        the race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal,
                        the Site reserves the right to remove the runner after
                        completion of the race. In this case only those bets
                        matched prior to the off will be affected by a reduction
                        factor.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a non-runner
                        being removed from a race in error or following
                        incorrect information regarding a runner's
                        participation, the Site will reinstate both the runner
                        and all previously matched bets associated with that
                        runner. All bets made between the time of withdrawal and
                        reinstatement will be void in both the place market and
                        the win market. The reduction factor applied to matched
                        bets at the time of withdrawal will be reversed and the
                        original prices will become valid.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any non-runners will be removed
                        from the relevant markets in the order in which they are
                        brought to the Site's attention. If the Site becomes
                        aware of more than one non-runner at the same time, it
                        will remove the non-runners from the relevant markets in
                        racecard order.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a runner is not included in
                        a market because of an error or because of incorrect
                        information regarding a runner's participation, the Site
                        reserves the right to introduce the missing runner into
                        the market at any time prior to settlement (even after
                        the race has been run), provided that the Site has
                        determined that the missing runner is not a material
                        runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of
                        approx. 2.5% or less in the win market). In such
                        circumstances, all pre-play unmatched and matched bets
                        will stand, however if the runner is not introduced
                        before the start of the race, all in-play bets will be
                        void. However, if the missing runner is deemed to be a
                        material runner, then the malformed market will be void
                        and a new market will be loaded where possible.

                        How the Reductions are applied for Exchange markets
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the win market, reductions
                        will be made on the traded price.
                        <br />
                        For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor
                        is 25% the potential winnings on all previously matched
                        bets on the other horses will be reduced by 25% - a
                        traded price of 8.0 would become 6.25.
                        <br />
                        For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor
                        is 25% the traded price on all previously matched bets
                        on other horses will be reduced by 25% - - traded price
                        of 8.0 would become 6.0. If the each Way terms were
                        1/5th odds for 3 places, the corresponding price for the
                        Place portion of the bet would reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place market, reductions
                        will be made to the potential winnings on the bet only,
                        and not the traded price.
                        <br />
                        For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor
                        is 25% the traded price on all previously matched bets
                        on other horses will be reduced by 25% - traded price of
                        8.0 would become 6.0 etc. And these might be further
                        reduced if another horse is subsequently declared a
                        non-runner.
                        <br />
                        For example a £10 bet on a horse to be placed at a
                        traded price of 8.0 would provide winnings of £70. If
                        there is a non-runner with a reduction factor of 25% in
                        the race, that factor will be applied to the £70 of
                        potential winnings leaving potential winnings of £52.50.
                        Therefore the revised traded price will be 6.25.
                        <br />
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traded price may be further
                        reduced if any other horse(s) is subsequently declared a
                        non-runner, however odds cannot be reduced below 1.01.
                        <br />
